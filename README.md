# FORKIFY! :fork_and_knife:

### People who love food are always the best people :spaghetti: :yum: 

## Explanation:

* A recipe searching application in which you can search over 1,000,000 recipes. 
* The recipes actually come from a real world API that I have used. 
* The search list consists of only 10 searches per page as I have implemented pagination. You can click on the next pages to scroll through different results.
* You can select one of the result and then again loads it from the external API.
* As soon as it loads the recipe, it stops the spinner, and then displays the recipe.
* You can also adjust the number of servings and the amount of ingredients then automatically adjusts.
* You can then also add these ingredients to a shopping list. 
* You can also adjust the number of any ingredient in the shopping list or delete any particular item.
* You can save these recipes in your favorites by hitting the like button on the recipe page.
* If you have one or more favourites then a like icon will appear on the top right corner which will contain the list of all you favourite recipes.
* Even after reloading the page you will still see the data persists and your favourite recipes are still stored which is done using local storage API.
